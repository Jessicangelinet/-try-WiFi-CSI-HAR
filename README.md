## Introduction

This repository contains the materials for the final year project on Human Activity Recognition using Wi-Fi signals. The project involves preprocessing Channel State Information (CSI) signals collected from Raspberry Pi and visualizing the data to recognize different human activities.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several key components:
- **Hardware**: Integrating Hardware components necessary for data collection.
- **Data Collection**: Collecting CSI data using Raspberry Pi(Rx) and Router(Tx) and visualizing the collected data in real-time.
- **Preprocessing**: Filtering and transforming the CSI data.
- **Feature Extraction and Annotation**: Extracting relevant features from the preprocessed data and annotating the data for training.
- **Model Training**: Developing a machine learning model architecture and training the model to recognize different human activities.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the CSI data and the results of the different activity recognition.
