## Main Reference Papers

These are the reference papers which inspired us to explore on a project related to Wi-Fi signals. The research projects in these papers are highly relevant to our final year project.

- [A CSI-Based Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning](<A CSI-Based Human Activity Recognition Using Deep Learning.pdf>)
    - This is the first paper which peaked our interest in this subject matter. [credit: [ayyp1](https://github.com/ayyp1) found this paper]
- [Human Activity Recognition based on Wi-Fi CSI Data -A Deep Neural Network Approach](<Human Activity Recognition based on Wi-Fi CSI Data -A Deep Neural Network Approach.pdf>)
    - This paper provides the code as well as github repo link. [Found by Kishor sir]
- [WiFi-based human activity recognition through wall using deep learning](<WiFi-based human activity recognition through wall using deep learning.pdf>)
    - This is the main reference which is highly relevant to our project and the main basis for through the wall HAR model and experiment setup (Hardware requirements).
