- [High Performance HAR](<High Performance HAR.pdf>)
    - Research Paper by same author as [WiFi-based human activity recognition through wall using deep learning](https://github.com/xaxm007/Major-Project/blob/655cc304c566b41e13df87b79e11ab7c861bf402/Main%20Reference%20Papers/WiFi-based%20human%20activity%20recognition%20through%20wall%20using%20deep%20learning.pdf).
    - This paper does not use the Wi-Fi adapter but enhances the performance by better preprocessing.
- [Wi-Fi Eye](<Wi-Fi Eye.pdf>)
    - Includes code the real-time visualization of CSI data and a GUI for ease in data collection.
